# Python_ML

Performed Machine Learning Workflow using Python Jupyter notebook

1) Data Cleaning
2) Feature Engineering
3) Outlier Removal
4) Data Visualization- Scatter Plot, Histogram, Box Plot, Line Plot
5) Model Building & Prediction ML's using scikit-learn library

The model building & Prediction is done using various techniques as mentioned below:

Supervised ML- 
Classification using Naive Bayes, SVMs, decision trees, Random forests
& Regression Techniques using Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Lasso, Ridge, SVR
Unsupervised ML - 
Clustering using K-means, DBScan , Spectral clustering 
& Dimensionality Reduction Techniques using Manifold learning, factor analysis

There is a folder Datasets, which contains all the csv data files. These are used to create ML models and prediction was made using several algos as mentioned above. Almost all the datasets are from Kaggle.
